# Testing the Common Model of Cognition as a Brain Architecture

This project aims to examine the feasibility of the Common Model of Cognition as a feasibile, high-level brain architecture. It is a joint project carried out with [John Laird](https://laird.engin.umich.edu/) of the University of Michigan, Christian Lebiere of Carnegie Mellon University, and [Paul Rosenbloom](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Rosenbloom/Paul) of the University of Southern California.   

## The Common Model of Cognition

The Common Model of Cognition (CMC, formerly known as the "Standard Model of the Mind") is an abstract blueprint of how basic cognitive functionalities can be put together to support human and human-like intelligence:

## Analysis of the Human Connectome Project Data

To test the CMC, each of the components of the CMC is identified with one or more brain regions, and the relationships between them translated into hypothesied patterns of effective connectivity.

These patterns are then translated into a neural network model using Dynamic Causal Modeling.    

These network models can then be tested against a large repository of brain imaging data, the [Human Connectome Project](https://www.humanconnectome.org/)(HCP).

The different folders in this repository describe a number of comparative analysis carried out on the HCP data.
