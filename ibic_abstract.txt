Evidence for a General Functional Architecture in the Human Connectome
Data

by Andrea Stocco

The Common Model of Cognition is a recently proposed, minimal, general-purpose
architecture that captures the lessons learned from decades of research in artificial intelligence, robotics,
and cognitive architectures. Because of its generality, it has been
suggested that the CMC also provides a reasonable model of human cognition. If true, the CMC could provide a reliable top-down framework to understand the large-scale functional anatomy of the human brain.
This talk will present the results of a series of studies that
explicitly test this hypothesis across data a large set of functional MRI data from N=168 participants. In this test, the CMC components were
identified with functionally homologous brain regions, and the
communication pathways between components were translated into predicted
patterns of effective connectivity between regions. The resulting model was implemented and fitted using Dynamic Causal Modeling, and compared against four alternative,
brain architectures that had been proposed in the field of neuroscience (two
hierarchical architectures and two hub-and-spoke architectures).
Using a Bayesian approach, the five models were compared across six
task-related fMRI dataset from the Human Connectome Project, spanning
the domains of emotional processing, reward processing, language
understanding, social reasoning, relational reasoning, and working
memory updating. The results show that, in all cases, the CMC vastly
outperforms all other architectures, both in individual tasks and in terms of overall fit across tasks. Furthermore, the internal
parameters of the CMC were correlated within individuals across
different tasks, suggesting that the CMC can be used to capture
both the common architecture and individual variation within it. The results suggest that a common, invariant architecture might underly both human and artificial forms of intelligence.
