Evidence for a General-Purpose Functional Architecture in the Human Connectome
Data

by Andrea Stocco

The Common Model of Cognition is a recently proposed, minimal,
architecture that captures the lessons learned from developing
intelligent agents in the fields of artificial intelligence, robotics,
and cognitive architectures. Because of its generality, it has been
suggested that the CMC also explains the human cognitive
architectures, and, henceforth, must be true of the brain. If true,
this would provide a top-down framework to understand the large-scale human brain.
In this talk, I will present the result of a series of studies that
explicitly test this hypothesis across data from the Human Connectome
Project. To proceed with this test, the components of the CMC were
identified with functionally related brain regions, and the
hypothetical connectivity of the CMC was translated into predicted
effective connectivity patterns. The resulting model was implemented
using Dynamic Causal Modeling, and compared against four alternative,
hypothetical brain architectures that had been derived from the literature (two
hierarchical architectures and two hub-and-spoke architectures)
Using a Bayesian approach, the five models were compared across six
task-related fMRI dataset from the Human Connectome Project, spanning
the domains of emotional processing, reward processing, language
understanding, social reasoning, relational reasoning, and working
memory updating. The results show that, in all cases, the CMC vastly
outperforms all other architectures. Furthermore, the internal
parameters of the CMC were highly correlated within individuals across
different tasks, suggesting that the CMC can be used to capture
both the common architecture and individual variation within it.
